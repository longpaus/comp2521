Question 2

(a) What are the time complexities of fnA() and fnB() in terms of a and
    b? Justify your answer.
fnA:
for each recursive stage the time complexities is O(1). And there are b - a
stage. Hence the time complexities is O(b - a).
fnB:
for every recursive stage the function calls fnA so the time complexity is O((b - a)^2).

(b) What does the function fn() do? Justify your answer.
sort array in ascending order.This is a selction sort.
