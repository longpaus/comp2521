Question 5

(a) How many times is the statement in line 3 executed (initialization
    of components) in terms of n and m?

n

(b) How many times is the statement in line 6 executed (deleting an edge
    from the list of edges) in terms of n and m?

m

(c) What is the time complexity (in big-O notation) of testing whether
    two nodes are in different components?
O(1)


(d) In the worst case, how many times is the statement in line 8
    executed (merging two components) in terms of n and m? Justify your
    answer.



(e) What is the worst case time complexity (in big-O notation) of
    merging two components into a single component? Justify your answer.



(f) What is the overall worst case time complexity (in big-O notation)
    of this algorithm? Ignore the complexity of lines 1 and 4. Justify
    your answer.
