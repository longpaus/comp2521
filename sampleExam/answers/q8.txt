Question 8

Describe in detail the steps you would perform to tell the sort programs apart.

Refer to sorting algorithm lectures for more details

- To distinguish merge sort from the others, use the fact that merge
  sort is always O(n log n).

- To distinguish naive quicksort from the others, use the fact that
  naive quicksort is O(n log n) on average (e.g., if given a random
  array), but is O(n^2) when given a sorted array.

- To distinguish bubble sort from insertion sort, use arrays which are
  sorted except that the largest element is at the beginning of the
  array and the smallest element is at the end. Insertion sort will
  be O(n), while bubble sort will be O(n^2).
