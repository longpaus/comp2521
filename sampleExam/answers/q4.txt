Question 4

(a) How many words are stored in this trie?

11

(b) Which nodes would be visited in searching for "deeds"?

Just 'd'

(c) Explain what changes would be made in the trie if the word "bogus"
    was added.

The trie already contains the path "bog", so the path would be extended
with two new nodes 'u' and 's', and the 's' would be marked as a
finishing node.

(d) Explain what changes would be made in the trie if the word "do" was
    added.

The trie already contains the word "dog", of which "do" is a prefix, so
the 'o' would just be marked as a finishing node.
