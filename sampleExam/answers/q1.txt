Question 1

O(n log n)

Since the algorithm recursively breaks a problem into two subproblems of
half the size until the size of a subproblem is one or zero, there are
log n levels of recursion, where on the first level, the main problem of
size n is broken into two subproblems of size ~n/2, on the second level,
each subproblem of size ~n/2 is broken into two smaller subproblems of
size ~n/4 (four subproblems in total) and so on.

Across each level, the work done to break the subproblems on that level
into two smaller subproblems and to combine the results of subproblems
is O(n).

Hence the time complexity of the algorithm is O(n log n).
