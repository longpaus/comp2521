Question 1

What is the time complexity of the algorithm? Justify your answer.

O(nlogn)
Since the algorithm breaks the size into n/2 repeatedly there will be 
logn levels of recursion. To break each level in half is O(n) and to combine
two recursive level is O(n). Hence the overall time complexity is O(nlogn).
