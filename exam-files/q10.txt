Question 10

Which of the listed data structures is most suitable? Justify your
answer. You must use time complexities as a basis for your justification.

To do the push operation the ordered link list the time complexity would be O(nlogn) as
it would require the value to be inserted and the link list to be sorted with merge sort
or something similiar. The ordered array would also be O(nlogn) however with the array there is
a limit of how many elements are allowed. The hash table would be O(1) and the heap would be O(logn).

For the pop operation the heap would be the fastest as it do the operation in O(logn) time while the other
data structures would take O(n) time.

for the remove in range operation the heap would take O(nlogn) while the other data structures would take O(n).

overall the hash table would be the fastest.
