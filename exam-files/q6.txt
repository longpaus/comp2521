Question 6

(a) Show the state of the array after the first four scans.

(Replace the underlines with the array elements)

[0]  [1]  [2]  [3]  [4]  [5]  [6]  [7]  [8]  [9]  [10]  [11]
4     5    14   15   98   26   71    96  41   55   100  46

(b) Show the state of the array after each pass of the algorithm.

Initial state:

[0]  [1]  [2]  [3]  [4]  [5]  [6]  [7]  [8]  [9]  [10]  [11]
98   26   71   96   15   55   100   4   46   41    14    5

After the first pass:

[0]  [1]  [2]  [3]  [4]  [5]  [6]  [7]  [8]  [9]  [10]  [11]
___  ___  ___  ___  ___  ___  ___  ___  ___  ___  ____  ____

(Copy the above template as many times as needed)



(c) Identify two important differences between radix sort and merge
    sort.
    -radix sort is a non comparative sort unlike merge sort where values are compared to each other.
    -The complexity of radix sort is O(mn) whre n is the number of terms and m is the number of symbols.
    While the time complexity of merge sort is O(nlogn)


    Give one situation where radix sort would be more suitable than
    merge sort.
    radix sort would be best when the keys are short and the array is large.


    Give one situation where merge sort would be more suitable than
    radix sort.
    when there are alot of differnt keys and the array is smaller
