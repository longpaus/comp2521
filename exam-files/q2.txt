Question 2

What is the maximum input size that can be processed? Justify your
answer.
since the maximum of input the computer can proccess in a day is 10, that means
it produce 10/24 input per hour. Hence a computer 1000 times faster can processed
(10/24)*1000 inputs per hour. Hence the faster computer can handle 10000 inputs in a day.
