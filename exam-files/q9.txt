Question 9

Which data structure and algorithm would you use to solve the task?
Justify your answer.

This represents a minimum spanning tree problem hence the algorithm i would use is Prim's
algorithm and the data structure i would use is a priority queue. Prim's algorithm guarantee that 
the minimum spanning tree will be found hence we are able to connect are the island together
while keeping the cost as low as possible.
